        "By Parker Whitehead<br/><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "This jupyter notebook is a repurposing of the 'NEW HPC' notebook that has been commonly used to scrape websites for ConfliBERT. Although it is currently set up for a very niche and specific usecase (mining the online library of pdfs from https://www.corteidh.or.cr/), it can be modified to meet any pdf scraping need.<br/><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is currently broken into **4 main parts.** The **first** is setting your universal parameters. This is the same as usual, except there are a few new ones for pdf specific mining. The **second** part is a page-based scrape for article links given a specific endpoint. In this instance, it is collecting links to all pdf descriptions under the category of 'human rights,' or 'derechos humanos.' On a typical website, this would be sufficient to find the links to PDF downloads. <br/><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**However**, this website uses a PDF viewer and requires a login. As such, I am using a workaround where I collect the links of pdf descriptions, which contain the title of the pdf as well as the ID of the pdf file. After doing some digging in the javascript code, I found out that the pdf viewer was hitting an endpoint on the server that contained the raw PDF file. Conveniently, it was not protected, meaning that you didn't have to log in or meet any pay wall that you would if you tried to access the pdf normally thorugh the viewer. The endpoint for the pdfs was indexable given that you had the pdf ID.<br/><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the purpose behind the **third part,** which scrapes the pdf descriptions not for links to the pdf or for raw text, but for the pdf title and ID. There is also an **intermediate step** where a library is used to ensure that the title is in spanish, as there are a fair number of english articles. The **fourth** is the actual PDF scraping.<br/><br/>\n",
        "\n",
        "Every website is going to be different, so it is almost certian that you are going to have to modify this script in some way. However, it is generally as simple as finding a way to hit a websites endpoint that contain the raw PDFs. The best way that I've found to customize these notebooks is by creating new extract functions, like extract_text() and extract_text_from_df(), which are parallelized with the parallelize_dataframe function. Reading through this scraper should hopefully provide context as to how they work and how you can create your own."
